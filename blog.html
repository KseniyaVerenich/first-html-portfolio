                                        <p id=""> Wow! The first week of bootcamp has come to a close, and it was quite the doozy!</p>
                                        <p>First week topics included HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Being fairly familiar with HTML and CSS,</p>
                                        <p>I felt comfortable with diving right in, however, I had no idea Bootstrap even existed! </p>
                                        <p>Quickly building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web is made easy with Bootstrap,</p>
                                        <p>and was a very exciting tool to learn how to use! Moving forward, I would definitely like to</p>
                                        <p>continue to develop my skills in html/css/bootstrap, and learn how to create more interactive</p>
                                        <p>and functional web pages.</p>

                                            <p>Diving into javascript this week, I was initially really excited to get started.</p>
                                            <p>However, things became difficult rather quickly. Our assigned challenges/exercises tested my patience </p>
                                            <p>and confidence. By Tuesday evening, I was ready to quit the program! Every new bit of information </p>
                                            <p>seemed daunting, and I wasn't convinced that I'd ever be able to get a good grasp on it.  On Wednesday, though,</p>
                                            <p>things quickly turned around! We worked in pairs to complete our assigned "weather app" exercise, and I </p>
                                            <p>had more than one "Aha!" moment. The relationship between javascript and HTML clicked, and I was able to better</p>
                                            <p>understand how to use javascript to code more dynamically. I did find, however, that a lot of time was spent </p>
                                            <p> trying to find minor syntax errors, which is something I would definitely categorize under "things that I hate"</p>
                                            <p>as a new programmer. I am definitely a bit anxious about starting Vue next week. My fingers are crossed that the upcoming</p>
                                            <p>week sees more wins than fails!

                                            What was an "Aha" moment this week that sparked a new realization or understanding of a topic.
                                            Name at least one cool thing you learned this week about coding.
                                            What are three ideas you might want to do for your final project
                                            Favorite project/exercise of the week? (make sure they are linked on your main page in a projects.html or some sort of portfolio)
                                            offer suggestions to improve at least three blogs
